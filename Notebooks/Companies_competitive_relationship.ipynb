Additionally, the infusion of generative\\nAI into an increasing number of applications is giving rise to the need for the enhanced AI processing capabilities\\nof our RTX GPUs.\\n\\nThe NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with\\nphysically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and\\ncontent creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to\\naccelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs and software.\\n\\nWe offer NVIDIA Omniverse as a development platform and operating system for building and running virtual world\\nsimulation applications, available as a software subscription for enterprise use and free for individual use.\\nIndustrial enterprises are adopting Omniverse’s 3D and simulation technologies to digitalize their complex physical\\nassets, processes, and environments – building digital twins of factories, real time 3D product configurators,\\ntesting and validating autonomous robots and vehicles, powered by NVIDIA accelerated computing infrastructure on-\\npremises and in the cloud.\\n 6 \\nTable of Contents\\n \\n Automotive \\n \\nAutomotive is comprised of platform solutions for automated driving from the cloud to the car. Leveraging our\\ntechnology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a\\ncomplete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE Hyperion brand. We have demonstrated multiple\\napplications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also\\nbe a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.\\n\\nWe are working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-\\none suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to\\ndevelop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training\\ndeep neural networks using our Data Center computing solutions, and then running a full perception, fusion,\\nplanning, and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion platform. DRIVE Hyperion consists of\\nthe high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware running an in-vehicle operating system (DRIVE\\nOS), a reference sensor set that supports full self-driving capability as well as an open, modular DRIVE software\\nplatform for autonomous driving, mapping, and parking services, and intelligent in-vehicle experiences.\\n\\nIn addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution based on NVIDIA Omniverse software to\\ndevelop synthetic data for AI model training, as well as for testing and validating a self-driving platform. Our\\nunique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development,\\nenabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a\\nvehicle.\\n \\n Business Strategies \\n \\nNVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:\\n\\nAdvancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. Our accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems\\nin significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, it\\ncan help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that\\noutpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, interconnect, algorithm,\\nand software layers. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance\\nadvantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Data Center, Gaming, Professional\\nVisualization, and Automotive. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them\\nwith a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs, CPUs, CUDA and networking technologies as the\\nfundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in\\nresearch and development: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with shared underlying technology\\nby using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and partners. We\\nutilize this platform approach in each of our target markets.\\n\\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing\\nplatform for AI, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes full-stack data center-scale compute and\\nnetworking solutions across processing units, interconnects, systems, and software. Our compute solutions include\\nall three major processing units in AI servers – GPUs, CPUs, and DPUs. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will\\ncontinue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position.\\n\\nIn addition, we offer DGX Cloud, a fully managed AI-training-as-a-service platform, along with NVIDIA AI\\nEnterprise—a comprehensive software suite designed to simplify the development and deployment of production-grade,\\nend-to-end generative AI applications. NVIDIA AI Enterprise includes: NVIDIA NIM, which delivers a 2.5x increase in\\ntoken throughput using industry-leading open and proprietary models; NVIDIA NeMo, a complete solution for curating,\\nfine-tuning, evaluating, and safeguarding domain-adapted models; and AI Blueprints, pre-built, runnable templates\\nthat help enterprises build, optimize, and deploy AI agents while preserving privacy. These tools enable\\norganizations to securely develop and run AI applications on NVIDIA-accelerated infrastructure anywhere.\\n\\nOur AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our computing\\nplatforms are available from virtually every major server maker and CSP, as well as on our own AI supercomputers.\\nThere are over 5.9 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our\\ntechnology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and thousands\\nof startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the\\nlatest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated\\ncomputing platform.\\n\\nExtending our technology and platform leadership in computer graphics. We believe that computer graphics infused\\nwith AI is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development\\nresources to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications and\\ncreate new virtual world and simulation capabilities. Our technologies are instrumental in driving the gaming,\\ndesign, and creative industries forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to deliver an\\noptimized experience on our GeForce and NVIDIA RTX platforms. Our computer graphics platforms leverage AI end-to-\\nend, from the developer tools and cloud services to the Tensor Cores included in all RTX-class GPUs. For example,\\nNVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine, or ACE, is\\n 7 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\na suite of technologies that help developers bring digital avatars to life with generative AI, running in the cloud\\nor locally on the PC. GeForce Experience enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as\\nwell as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. Our Studio drivers enhance and accelerate a number of\\npopular creative applications. Omniverse is real-time 3D design collaboration and virtual world simulation software\\nthat empowers artists, designers, and creators to connect and collaborate in leading design applications. We also\\nenable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be\\naccessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as vGPU for enterprise and GeForce\\nNOW for gaming.\\n\\nAdvancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of autonomous vehicles, or AV, and\\nelectric vehicles, or EV, is revolutionizing the transportation industry. The algorithms required for autonomous\\ndriving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and\\nwill use multiple neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide an AI-based hardware and software solution,\\ndesigned and implemented from the ground up based on automotive safety standards, for the AV and EV market under\\nthe DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive OEMs, tier-1 suppliers,\\nand start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before\\ntheir in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates.\\nWe believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to\\nsolve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.\\n\\nLeveraging our intellectual property, or IP. We believe our IP is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our\\ncustomers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities\\ndirectly into their own products or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development\\narrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.\\n \\n Sales and Marketing \\n \\nOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-\\nperformance and efficient computing platforms and software. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our\\nglobal markets, work closely with customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our\\npartner network incorporates global, regional and specialized CSPs, OEMs, ODMs, ISVs, global system integrators,\\nadd-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, distributors, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, and\\nother ecosystem participants.\\n\\nMembers of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of\\napplication engineers and solution architects to provide pre-sales assistance to our partner network in designing,\\ntesting, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. For example, our solution architects work\\nwith CSPs to provide pre-sales assistance to enable our customers to optimize their hardware and software\\ninfrastructure for generative AI and LLM training and deployment. They also work with foundation model and\\nenterprise software developers to enable our customers to optimize the training and fine-tuning of their models and\\nservices, and with enterprise end-users, often in collaboration with their global system integrator of choice, to\\nfine-tune models and build AI applications. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to\\nimproving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering\\nrelationships that encourage our customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within\\neach platform.\\n\\nTo encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms and software, we seek to establish and\\nmaintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage\\nwith key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product\\nrequirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program supports the development of AI frameworks, SDKs,\\nand APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning\\nInstitute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to\\nbuild AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.\\n \\n Seasonality \\n \\nOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as data centers, gaming, professional visualization,\\nand automotive. Our desktop gaming products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year.\\nHistorical seasonality trends may not repeat.\\n \\n Manufacturing \\n \\nWe utilize a fabless and contracting manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ and partner with key suppliers for\\nall phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. We use the\\nexpertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in\\nsuch areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can\\navoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While\\nwe may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as memory, substrates,\\nand a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most raw materials used in the\\nproduction of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, quality assurance,\\nmarketing, and customer support. In periods\\n 8 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nof growth, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our\\nhistorical lead times, pay premiums, or provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity and may need to\\ncontinue to do so.\\n\\nWe have expanded our supplier relationships to build redundancy and resilience in our operations to provide long-\\nterm manufacturing capacity aligned with growing customer demand. Our supply chain is mainly concentrated in the\\nAsia-Pacific region. We utilize foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, or TSMC, and\\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd., or Samsung, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We purchase memory from SK Hynix\\nInc., Micron Technology, Inc., and Samsung. We utilize CoWoS technology for semiconductor packaging. We engage with\\nindependent subcontractors and contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., Wistron\\nCorporation, and Fabrinet to perform assembly, testing and packaging of our final products.\\n \\n Competition \\n \\nThe market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and\\nevolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance,\\nbreadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support,\\nconformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We\\nbelieve that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and\\nfunctions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our\\nproducts at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both\\nexisting competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours or may provide better\\nperformance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors\\nor alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.\\n\\nA significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, CPUs, DPUs,\\nembedded SoCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-\\nperformance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel, and proprietary technologies. Some\\nof our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and\\nmay be more able to adapt to customers or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment\\nin the future.\\n\\nOur current competitors include:\\n\\n• suppliers and licensors of hardware and software for discrete and integrated GPUs, custom chips and other\\naccelerated computing solutions, including solutions offered for AI, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD,\\nHuawei Technologies Co. Ltd., or Huawei, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\\n\\n• large cloud services companies with internal teams designing hardware and software that incorporate accelerated\\nor AI computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet\\nInc., Amazon, Inc., or Amazon, Baidu, Inc., Huawei, and Microsoft Corporation, or Microsoft;\\n\\n• suppliers of Arm-based CPUs and companies that incorporate hardware and software for CPUs as part of their\\ninternal solutions or platforms, such as Amazon, Huawei, and Microsoft;\\n\\n• suppliers of hardware and software for SoC products that are used in servers or embedded into automobiles,\\nautonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom, Inc., or Broadcom, Intel, Qualcomm\\nIncorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products\\nfor their own products and services, such as Tesla, Inc.; and\\n\\n• networking products consisting of switches, network adapters (including DPUs), and cable solutions (including\\noptical modules) include such as AMD, Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise\\nCompany, Huawei, Intel, Lumentum Holdings Inc., and Marvell Technology, Inc. as well as internal teams of system\\nvendors and large cloud services companies.\\n \\n Patents and Proprietary Rights \\n \\nWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure\\nagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently\\nissued patents have expiration dates from February 2025 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and\\npending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily\\nrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international\\ntreaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our\\nproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or\\nIP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of\\npiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal\\nprotection for innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\\n\\n• the location in which our products are manufactured;\\n 9 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\n• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\\n\\n• the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\\n\\n• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and\\nregions.\\n\\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue entering such license agreements.\\n \\n Government Regulations \\n \\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well\\nas of foreign governments.\\n\\nOver the past three years, we have been subject to a series of shifting and expanding export control restrictions,\\nimpacting our ability to serve customers outside the United States.\\n\\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government, or the USG, announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions,\\nimpact exports to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or\\nany other systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\n\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\\n\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\\nperformance density.\\n\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\n\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\\ncustomers.\\n\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

       " '7': 'Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations │\\n│ │\\n╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\\nconjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well\\nas other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to\\npurchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\\n \\n Overview \\n \\n \\n Our Company and Our Businesses \\n \\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our\\noriginal focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive\\nfields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has\\nleveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and\\ndigital twin applications.\\n\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\\ninformation.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in\\nDelaware in April 1998.\\n\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\n \\n Demand and Supply \\n \\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated\\ncomputing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We\\nbegan shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\\n\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue\\nor supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated\\ncomputing and generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased\\ndemand for our Data Center systems.\\n\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand\\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and\\nmay continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future\\nproducts. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our\\nsupply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning,\\nexecution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead\\nto increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if\\nour inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\n \\n Product Transitions and New Product Introductions \\n \\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our\\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the\\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing\\nindustry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing\\nand diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center\\nsolutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center\\nofferings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product\\nconfigurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create\\nvolatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in\\nquality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in\\nproduct delays. We incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product\\nroadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may\\ndelay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new\\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have\\nmanaged prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions\\nare difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur\\nadditional costs.\\n \\n Global Trade \\n \\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China\\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or\\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\n 36 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIn July 2023, the USG informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 and H100 products\\ndestined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\n\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth\\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to\\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain\\nperformance thresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The\\nlicensing requirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party\\nheadquartered in, or with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. On October 23,\\n2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100,\\nA800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems,\\nsuch as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a\\nlicense for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To\\ndate, we have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that\\npartners and customers have also not received a license to ship these restricted products.\\n\\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not\\nrequire a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China\\nthat do not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025. As a\\npercentage of total Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in\\nOctober 2023. The market in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with\\nexport controls while serving our customers. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the\\nlicensing requirements, we may seek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a\\nlicense, or that the USG will act on the license application in a timely manner or at all.\\n\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed\\ncompliance period, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products\\nclassified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs,\\nincluding all related software and technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated\\ncircuits, or ICs, (including but not limited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new\\nlicensing requirement. The licensing requirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with\\nECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or\\nperformance density.\\n\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA\\nproducts, and any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited\\nto: A100, A800, H100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\n\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future\\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given\\nthe increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again\\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export\\nrestrictions and licensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of\\nsuch change, we may be unable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement\\nproducts not subject to the licensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market,\\nas well as other impacted markets, including the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion\\nIFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that\\nincorporate technologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China. For example, the USG is\\nconsidering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive products in the United States, which if\\nadopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply solutions for our automotive\\ncustomers.\\n\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the\\nAsia-Pacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit\\nalternative manufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks\\nRelated to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\\n \\n Macroeconomic Factors \\n \\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain\\nconstraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on\\nour results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these\\nmacroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment\\nand value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes\\nin our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\n 37 \\nTable of Contents\\n \\n Israel and Regional Conflicts \\n \\nWe are monitoring the impact of the geopolitical conflict in and around Israel on our operations, including the\\nhealth and safety of our approximately 4,700 employees in the region who primarily support the research and\\ndevelopment, operations, and sales and marketing of our networking products. Our global supply chain for our\\nnetworking products has not experienced any significant impact. Some of our employees in the region have been on\\nactive military duty for an extended period and may continue to be absent, which may cause disruption to our\\nproduct development or operations. We have not experienced significant impact or expense to our business; however,\\nif the conflict is further extended or expanded, it could impact future product development, operations, and\\nrevenue or create other uncertainty for our business.\\n \\n Fiscal Year 2025 Summary \\n \\n \\n Year Ended \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Change \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -$ in millions, except per \\n share data \\n Revenue $ 130,497 $ 60,922 Up 114% \\n Gross margin 75.0 % 72.7 % Up 2.3 pts \\n Operating expenses $ 16,405 $ 11,329 Up 45% \\n Operating income $ 81,453 $ 32,972 Up 147% \\n Net income $ 72,880 $ 29,760 Up 145% \\n Net income per diluted share $ 2.94 $ 1.19 Up 147% \\n \\nWe specialize in markets where our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These\\nplatforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver unique\\nvalue. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Data Center, Gaming, Professional\\nVisualization, and Automotive.\\n\\nRevenue for fiscal year 2025 was $130.5 billion, up 114% from a year ago.\\n\\nData Center revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 142% from a year ago. The strong year-on-year growth was driven by\\ndemand for our Hopper architecture accelerated computing platform used for large language models, recommendation\\nengines, and generative AI applications. We began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the\\nfourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\\n\\nGaming revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 9% from a year ago, driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\\n\\nProfessional Visualization revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 21% from a year ago, driven by the continued ramp of\\nAda RTX GPU workstations for use cases such as generative AI-powered design, simulation, and engineering.\\n\\nAutomotive revenue for fiscal year 2025 was up 55% from a year ago, driven by sales of our self-driving platforms.\\n\\nGross margin increased in fiscal year 2025 driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\\n\\nOperating expenses for fiscal year 2025 were up 45% from a year ago, driven by higher compensation and benefits\\nexpenses due to employee growth and compensation increases, and engineering development, compute and infrastructure\\ncosts for new product introductions.\\n \\n Critical Accounting Estimates \\n \\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\\nthe United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and\\njudgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related\\ndisclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of\\nestimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We\\nhave critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, income taxes, and revenue recognition. Refer to\\nNote 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\\nfor a summary of significant accounting policies.\\n \\n Inventories \\n \\nWe charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable\\nvalue or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory\\nprovisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product\\npurchase\\n 38 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\ncommitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.\\n\\nSituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes\\nin business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for\\nour products, including potential cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders, inventory obsolescence\\nbecause of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for\\nexisting products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in\\nadvance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in\\ndemand for competitive products, including competitive actions.\\n\\nThe net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an\\nunfavorable impact of 2.3% in fiscal year 2025 and 2.7% in fiscal year 2024. Our inventory and capacity purchase\\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers\\' lead times\\nand constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve\\nmonths for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance\\nof our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also\\nadjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product\\ntransitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\n\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis for\\nfurther discussion.\\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and\\nliabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application\\nof complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added\\ncertainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign\\njurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities\\nfor potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which,\\nadditional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax\\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional\\nincome tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\n\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not\\nto be realized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-\\nlikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\n\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be\\nsustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest\\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\n \\n Revenue Recognition \\n \\n \\n Revenue Allowances \\n \\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance\\nfor estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates.\\nHowever, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine\\nthat additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return\\nrights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of\\nprior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns\\nfor credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.\\n\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in\\nrevenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer\\nprograms include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes\\nwhich require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program\\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant\\ninternal and external factors.\\n \\n License and Development Arrangements \\n \\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services\\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to\\ndate as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each\\nproject includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs\\nas applicable.\\n 39 \\nTable of Contents\\n \\n Contracts with Multiple Performance Obligations \\n \\nOur contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each\\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements,\\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration\\nor interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered\\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\n\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple\\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone\\nselling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable\\ncircumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not\\nsell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other\\nobservable inputs.\\n \\n Results of Operations \\n \\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal\\nyear 2024 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal\\nyear 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\\nyear ended January 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, which is available free of charge on the\\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.\\n\\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income\\nexpressed as a percentage of revenue.\\n \\n Year Ended \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % \\n Cost of revenue 25.0 27.3 \\n Gross profit 75.0 72.7 \\n Operating expenses \\n Research and development 9.9 14.2 \\n Sales, general and administrative 2.7 4.4 \\n Total operating expenses 12.6 18.6 \\n Operating income 62.4 54.1 \\n Interest income 1.4 1.4 \\n Interest expense -0.2 -0.4 \\n Other, net 0.8 0.4 \\n Other income (expense), net 2.0 1.4 \\n Income before income tax 64.4 55.5 \\n Income tax expense 8.6 6.6 \\n Net income 55.8 % 48.9 % \\n \\n 40 \\nTable of Contents\\n \\n Reportable Segments \\n \\n \\n Revenue by Reportable Segments \\n \\n \\n Year Ended $ % \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Change Change \\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -$ in millions \\n Compute & Networking $ 116,193 $ 47,405 $ 68,788 145 % \\n Graphics 14,304 13,517 787 6 % \\n Total $ 130,497 $ 60,922 $ 69,575 114 % \\n \\n \\n Operating Income by Reportable Segments \\n \\n \\n Year Ended $ % \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Change Change \\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -$ in millions \\n Compute & Networking $ 82,875 $ 32,016 $ 50,859 159 % \\n Graphics 5,085 5,846 -761 -13 % \\n All Other -6,507 -4,890 -1,617 33 % \\n Total $ 81,453 $ 32,972 $ 48,481 147 % \\n \\nCompute & Networking revenue – The year over year increase was due to strong demand for our accelerated computing\\nand AI solutions. Revenue from Data Center computing grew 162% driven primarily by demand for our Hopper computing\\nplatform used for large language models, recommendation engines, and generative AI applications. Revenue from Data\\nCenter networking grew 51% driven by Ethernet for AI revenue, which includes Spectrum-X end-to-end ethernet\\nplatform.\\n\\nGraphics revenue – The year over year increase was driven by sales of our GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs.\\n\\nReportable segment operating income – The year over year increase in Compute & Networking segment operating income\\nwas driven by growth in revenue. The year over year decrease in Graphics segment operating income was driven by an\\nincrease of 44% in segment operating expenses, partially offset by growth in revenue.\\n\\nAll Other operating loss – The year over year increase was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense\\nreflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\\n \\n Concentration of Revenue \\n \\nWe refer to customers who purchase products directly from NVIDIA as direct customers, such as AIBs, distributors,\\nODMs, OEMs, and system integrators. We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and\\nmay use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect\\ncustomers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet\\ncompanies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\\n\\nDirect Customers – Sales to direct customers which represented 10% or more of total revenue, all of which were\\nprimarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment, are presented in the following table:\\n \\n Year Ended \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n Direct Customer A 12 % * \\n Direct Customer B 11 % 13 % \\n Direct Customer C 11 % * \\n \\n* Less than 10% of total revenue.\\n\\nNo customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2023.\\n 41 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nIndirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer\\npurchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect\\ncustomer revenue may differ from our estimates. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily\\npurchases our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customer B, is\\nestimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\\n\\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of\\ncustomers, and this trend may continue.\\n\\nRevenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to\\nindirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted\\nfor 53% and 56% of total revenue for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\\n \\n Gross Profit and Gross Margin \\n \\nGross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of\\nsemiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing\\nsupport costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and\\nwarranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes\\nacquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements,\\nIP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\\n\\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase\\nwas primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\\n\\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal\\nyears 2025 and 2024, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory\\npurchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and\\n2024, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 2.3% and 2.7% in fiscal years\\n2025 and 2024, respectively.\\n \\n Operating Expenses \\n \\n \\n Year Ended $ % \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Change Change \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -$ in millions \\n Research and development expenses $ 12,914 $ 8,675 $ 4,239 49 % \\n % of net revenue 9.9 % 14.2 % \\n Sales, general and administrative 3,491 2,654 837 32 % \\n expenses \\n % of net revenue 2.7 % 4.4 % \\n Total operating expenses $ 16,405 $ 11,329 $ 5,076 45 % \\n % of net revenue 12.6 % 18.6 % \\n \\nThe increases in research and development expenses for fiscal year 2025 were driven by a 32% increase in\\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\\nincreases, a 100% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 234% increase in engineering development costs for\\nnew product introductions.\\n\\nThe increases in sales, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2025 were primarily driven by\\ncompensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation\\nincreases.\\n 42 \\nTable of Contents\\n \\n Other Income (Expense), Net \\n \\n \\n Year Ended $ \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 Change \\n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -$ in millions \\n Interest income $ 1,786 $ 866 $ 920 \\n Interest expense -247 -257 10 \\n Other, net 1,034 237 797 \\n Other income (expense), net $ 2,573 $ 846 $ 1,727 \\n \\nThe increase in interest income was primarily due to growth in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\\n\\nInterest expense is comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our notes.\\n\\nOther, net consists of realized or unrealized gains and losses from investments in non-marketable equity\\nsecurities, publicly-held equity securities, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. The change in\\nOther, net, compared to fiscal year 2024, was primarily driven by an increase in fair value of our non-marketable\\nequity securities and publicly-held equity securities. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial\\nStatements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our non-\\nmarketable equity securities.\\n \\n Income Taxes \\n \\nIncome tax expense was $11.1 billion and $4.1 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. Income tax as a\\npercentage of income before income tax was an expense of 13.3% and 12.0% for fiscal years 2025 and 2024,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nThe effective tax rate increased primarily due to higher pre-tax income and a prior year discrete benefit due to an\\naudit resolution.\\n\\nOur effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due\\nprimarily to tax benefits from the FDII deduction, stock-based compensation, the U.S. federal research tax credit,\\nand income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax\\nrate. Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was additionally benefited by the audit resolution.\\n\\nGiven our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated\\nwith certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period\\nthe release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our\\nassessment of all available information.\\n\\nRefer to Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K for additional information.\\n \\n Liquidity and Capital Resources \\n \\n \\n Jan 26, 2025 \\n (In millions) Jan 28, 2024 \\n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,589 $ 7,280 \\n Marketable securities 34,621 18,704 \\n Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities $ 43,210 $ 25,984 \\n \\n \\n Year Ended \\n Jan 26, 2025 Jan 28, 2024 \\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n -In millions \\n Net cash provided by operating activities $ 64,089 $ 28,090 \\n Net cash used in investing activities $ -20,421 $ -10,566 \\n Net cash used in financing activities $ -42,359 $ -13,633 \\n \\nOur investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of\\ninvestment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.\\n 43 \\nTable of Contents\\n\\nCash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, due to growth in\\nrevenue.\\n\\nCash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, primarily driven by\\nnet purchases of marketable securities, and purchase of land, property and equipment.\\n\\nCash used in financing activities increased in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2024, mainly due to higher\\nshare repurchases and higher tax payments related to RSUs.\\n \\n Liquidity \\n \\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated by our\\noperations. As of January 26, 2025, we had $43.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We\\nbelieve that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months\\nand thereafter for the foreseeable future, including our future supply obligations and share purchases. We\\ncontinuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we\\ncan finance future capital requirements.\\n\\nOur marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government\\nand its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as\\ncertificates of deposit issued by highly rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily\\ndenominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item\\n15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\n\\nExcept for approximately $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S.\\nfor which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S.,\\nsubstantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside the U.S. at the end of\\nfiscal year 2025 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.\\n \\n Capital Return to Shareholders \\n \\nOn August 26, 2024, our Board of Directors approved an additional $50 billion to our share repurchase\\nauthorization, without expiration. In fiscal year 2025, we repurchased 310 million shares of our common stock for\\n$34.0 billion. As of January 26, 2025, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase up to\\n$38.7 billion of our common stock.\\n\\nFrom January 27, 2025 through February 21, 2025, we repurchased 29 million shares for $3.7 billion pursuant to a\\npre-established trading plan. Our share repurchase program aims to offset dilution from shares issued to employees\\nwhile maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements. We may pursue additional share repurchases\\nas we weigh market factors and other investment opportunities.\\n\\nIn fiscal year 2025, we paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $834 million. The payment of future cash\\ndividends is subject to our Board of Directors\\' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in\\nthe best interests of our shareholders.\\n\\nThe U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares\\nissued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022. The excise tax is included in our share repurchase\\ncost and was not material for fiscal years 2025 and 2024.\\n\\nOutstanding Indebtedness and Commercial Paper Program\\n\\nOur aggregate debt maturities as of January 26, 2025, by year payable, are as follows:\\n \\n Jan 26, 2025 \\n (In millions) \\n ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── \\n Due in one year $ — \\n Due in one to five years 2,250 \\n Due in five to ten years 2,750 \\n Due in greater than ten years 3,500 \\n Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs -37 \\n Net long-term carrying amount $ 8,463 \\n \\nWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes.

We expect to increase capital expenditures in fiscal year 2026 relative to fiscal year 2025 to\\nsupport the future growth of our business.\\n\\nUnrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 billion, which includes related interest and penalties of $251 million, were\\nrecorded in non-current income tax payable at the end of fiscal year 2025. We are unable to estimate the timing of\\nany potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the\\nunderlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions.
